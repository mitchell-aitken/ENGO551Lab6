# ENGO 551 Lab 6 - Line Simplification for Web Mapping Applications
**Developer:** Mitchell Aitken

This lab creates a web mapping application that demonstrates the use of line simplification, utilizing Leaflet.js for map rendering and Turf.js for the simplification algorithm.

## Overview

The application allows users to draw polylines on a map and then simplifies these lines based on a specified slider tolerance. The simplification process helps in reducing the number of points in a polyline.

### Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the layout and the necessary JavaScript libraries.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for map interaction, polyline drawing, and line simplification.

### Features

- Interactive map rendered using Leaflet.js
- Ability to draw polylines on the map
- Simplification of polylines using Turf.js with adjustable tolerance
- Dark theme map tiles from CARTO for better visualization
